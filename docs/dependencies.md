## Libraries

### 1. RF24 Library
- **Description**: A popular library for interfacing with NRF24L01+ modules for wireless communication.
- **Version**: Latest stable release.
- **Repository**: [RF24 GitHub Repository](https://github.com/nRF24/RF24)
- **Installation Instructions**:
  1. Open the Arduino IDE.
  2. Go to **Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries**.
  3. Search for "RF24" in the Library Manager.
  4. Click **Install** to install the library.

- **Usage**:
  - The library provides functions for sending and receiving data using NRF24L01+ modules.
  - Example sketches are available in the `Examples` section of the Arduino IDE after installation.

## Additional Notes

- **Hardware Compatibility**:
  - Ensure that your microcontroller supports the required libraries.
  - For NRF24L01+ modules, ensure proper connections and power supply (a decoupling capacitor is often recommended).

- **Troubleshooting**:
  - If you encounter issues with the RF24 library, refer to the [RF24 Troubleshooting Guide](https://github.com/nRF24/RF24#troubleshooting).
